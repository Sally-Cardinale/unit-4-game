<h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <p>You will be given a random number at the start of the game.</p>
                <p>
                    There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific
                    amount of points to your total score.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You win the game by matching your total score to a random result selected by 
                    the computer. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random result.
                </p>
                <p>The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.</p>
                <p>
                    Each time when the game starts, the values of the random result and each crystal
                    will change.
                </p>
